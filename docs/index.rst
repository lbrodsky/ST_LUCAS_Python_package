ST_LUCAS Python API
===================

ST_LUCAS Python package (C1) provides communication between the web
server (A2) and the usersâ€™ clients through API. The package
implemented in the Python 3 programming language consists of three
modules: (1) ``request``: to create a request by specifying spatial,
temporal, attribute or thematic filters; (2) ``io``: to retrieve
harmonized LUCAS data provided by the web service (A2) based on the
submitted request, and to store the retrieved data to the user local
file system (C2) in a specified data format; (3) ``analyze``: to
analyze the received harmonized LUCAS data - LUCAS land cover classes
aggregation and nomenclature translation.

The client Python API can be used directly by the Python code (CLI),
running the `Jupyter Notebook <./tutorials.html>`__ or the `QGIS
developed plugin <../qgis_plugin/>`__ (GUI).
